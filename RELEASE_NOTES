1. What is Apache Ivy?

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
   		Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
   		methodology or structure. 
   		Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
   		to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
   		processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
   		while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
   		with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
   		from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.

2. Status of this release 

This is the development branch of Ivy. Any release branch should have a more
accurate description here.

As of this writing, the current production quality version is 2.3.0, published
by the ASF on January 21st, 2013.
