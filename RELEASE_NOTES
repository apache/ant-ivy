1. What is Apache Ivy?

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
   		Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
   		methodology or structure. 
   		Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
   		to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
   		processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
   		while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
   		with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
   		from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.

2. Status of this release 

This is the first official release made since Ivy has moved to the Apache Software
Foundation. We strongly encourage the use of this new version instead of the older
1.4.1 version, which has not been produced within the Apache Software Foundation.

3. Major Changes in this Release

This section describes what has changed between version 1.4.1 and this version of 
Apache Ivy which may cause incompatibilities. For a full list of detailed changes,
please refer to CHANGES.txt file.

This new version of Apache Ivy is almost fully compatible with 1.4 version as long 
as you do not use custom plugins: Ivy API has changed, but not its behavior.

Some tasks and configuration elements have been renamed, but the old versions
are still available, they are only deprecated (you will see deprecated warnings). 

3.1. Java Package Name Changes

All of the Ivy Java package names have changed in Apache Ivy. They now start 
with org.apache rather than fr.jayasoft. There have been other changes as well. 
Important refactorings have done on the source code to ease the understanding
of Ivy internal architecture by new developers.

A class named org.apache.ivy.Ivy14 is provided with an API compatible with the
fr.jayasoft.Ivy class of Ivy 1.4.1, to ease migration to this new version.

3.2. Configuration replaced by Settings

Configuration used to have two meanings in prior Ivy versions, causing some confusion
with new users.
To avoid this confusion, Apache Ivy calls settings instead of configuration the files
used to customize Ivy. Configuration is still used for module configurations.

Besides the changes in the documentation, this renaming also imply a modification
in settings files, which now use ivysettings as root element instead of ivyconf,
and settings instead of conf element to define top level defaults (such as 
defaultCache, ...).
Previous names have been deprecated, so previous settings files can still be used, but 
you will see a deprecation warning.

3.3. Public resolver in default settings is now ibiblio in m2 compatible mode

In previous versions Ivy used to use the ivyrep resolver as default public resolver, 
but ivyrep is no longer maintained, while maven 2 repository on ibiblio is growing rapidly.

Since Ivy is compatible with maven 2 repository, defaulting to the ibiblio maven 2 
repository makes more sense.

If you have any issue of backward compatibility with these new settings, you can simply 
set the following ant property before loading the settings (implicitly or explicitly):
ivy.14.compatible=true

3.4. Relative paths resolution

Relative paths resolution in Ivy used to be resolved against the current directory. 
In 2.0, relative path resolution is done like this:
* In an Ivy file, paths are relative to the Ivy file itself (the only possible path 
  in an Ivy file is for configurations declaration inclusion)
* In settings files, paths for file inclusion (namely properties file loading and 
  settings inclusion) are relative to the directory in which the settings file is 
  located. All other paths must be absolute unless explicitly noted.
* In Ivy Ant tasks and Ivy parameters or options, paths are relative to Ivy base 
  directory, which when called from Ant is the same as your Ant basedir.

This may break your dependency resolution if you used to use relative paths for configuration
file inclusion.

3.5 Ivyrep ivyroot attribute is now mandatory

If you still use the ivyrep resolver, you will need to provide an ivyroot.
To restore the previous behavior, use ivyroot="http://ivyrep.jayasoft.org/".

Since Ivyrep is not maintained anymore, we recommend moving away from this repository anyway.

3.6 alwaysCheckExactRevision now defaults to false

This property common to many resolvers is used to tell the resolver if the raw revision 
should be tested even when the revision is dynamic. This is used in very few use cases, 
so we decided to change the default to false.

If you want to set the default to true, set 'ivy.default.always.check.exact.revision' to 
'true' before loading Ivy settings.

4. Migrating from Jayasoft Ivy to Apache Ivy

Besides what is stated in "3. Major Changes in this Release"
Apache Ivy is fully compatible with Jayasoft Ivy as long as you do not use 
custom plugins.
This means that you can use Apache Ivy as a drop in replacement of Jayasoft Ivy
in most cases.

However due to the the renaming of configuration files to settings files, we
strongly suggest to update your configuration files:
- rename the files called ivyconf*.xml in ivysettings*.xml
- rename 'ivyconf' element in 'ivysettings'
- rename 'conf' element of those settings file in 'settings'

We also suggest using the new org.apache.ivy.ant package name for the antlib declaration.

Migrating custom plugins can be done by using the org.apache.ivy.Ivy14 class
instead of fr.jayasoft.ivy.Ivy, and reorganizing your imports to reflect the 
changes in the package names.
