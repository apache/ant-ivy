== What is Apache Ivy?

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:
sdsfsiema siema
1. flexibility and configurability
+
Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any
sdsdsdmethodology or structure.
Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability
to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build
processes.

2. tight integration with Apache Ant
MARCIN+
While available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well
sdsdwith Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging
from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.
