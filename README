                             Apache Ivy (TM)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is Apache Ivy?
--------------------

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
       Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
       methodology or structure. 
       Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
       to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
       processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
       while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
       with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
       from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.
