= Using standalone

Ivy can be used as a standalone program very easily. All you need is a Java 1.7+ runtime environment (JRE)!

Then here is how to call it:

[source,shell]
----
java -jar ivy.jar -?
----

It will display usage text as follows:

[source]
----
usage: ivy
==== settings options
 -settings <settingsfile>     use given file for settings
 -cache <cachedir>            use given directory for cache
 -novalidate                  do not validate ivy files against xsd
 -m2compatible                use Maven 2 compatibility

==== resolve options
 -ivy <ivyfile>               use given file as ivy file
 -refresh                     refresh dynamic resolved revisions
 -dependency <organisation> <module> <revision>
                              use this instead of ivy file to do the rest of the
                               work with this as a dependency.
 -confs <configurations>      resolve given configurations
 -types <types>               comma separated list of accepted artifact types
 -mode <resolvemode>          the resolve mode to use
 -notransitive                do not resolve dependencies transitively

==== retrieve options
 -retrieve <retrievepattern>  use given pattern as retrieve pattern
 -ivypattern <pattern>        use given pattern to copy the ivy files
 -sync                        use sync mode for retrieve
 -symlink                     create symbolic links

==== cache path options
 -cachepath <cachepathfile>   outputs a classpath consisting of all dependencies
                               in cache (including transitive ones) of the given
                               ivy file to the given cachepathfile

==== deliver options
 -deliverto <ivypattern>      use given pattern as resolved ivy file pattern

==== publish options
 -publish <resolvername>      use given resolver to publish to
 -publishpattern <artpattern> use given pattern to find artifacts to publish
 -revision <revision>         use given revision to publish the module
 -status <status>             use given status to publish the module
 -overwrite                   overwrite files in the repository if they exist

==== http auth options
 -realm <realm>               use given realm for HTTP AUTH
 -host <host>                 use given host for HTTP AUTH
 -username <username>         use given username for HTTP AUTH
 -passwd <passwd>             use given password for HTTP AUTH

==== launcher options
 -main <main>                 the FQCN of the main class to launch
 -args <args>                 the arguments to give to the launched process
 -cp <cp>                     extra classpath to use when launching process

==== message options
 -debug                       set message level to debug
 -verbose                     set message level to verbose
 -warn                        set message level to warn
 -error                       set message level to error

==== help options
 -?                           display this help
 -deprecated                  show deprecated options
 -version                     displays version information

*__since 1.3__* System properties are included as ivy variables, so you can easily define an ivy variable like this:

[source,shell]
----
java -Dmyivyvar=myvalue org.apache.ivy.Main [parameters]
----

== Examples

[source,shell]
----
java -jar ivy.jar
----

calls ivy with default configuration using ivy.xml in the current dir

'''

[source,shell]
----
java -jar ivy.jar -settings path/to/myivysettings.xml -ivy path/to/myivy.xml
----

calls ivy with given ivysettings file using given ivy file

'''

*__since 1.3__*

[source,shell]
----
java -jar ivy.jar -settings path/to/myivysettings.xml -dependency apache commons-lang 2.0
----

calls ivy with given ivysettings file and resolve apache `commons-lang 2.0`.

This is equivalent to:

[source,shell]
----
java -jar ivy.jar -settings path/to/myivysettings.xml -ivy ivy.xml
----

with `ivy.xml` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<ivy-module version="1.0">
  <info organisation="org"
       module="standalone"
       revision="working"/>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency org="apache" name="commons-lang" rev="2.0" conf="default->*"/>
  </dependencies>
</ivy-module>
----

'''

*__since 1.3__*

[source,shell]
----
java -jar ivy.jar -settings path/to/myivysettings.xml -ivy path/to/myivy.xml -cachepath mycachefile.txt
----

calls ivy with given ivysettings file and resolves the dependencies found in the given ivy file, and then outputs the classpath of resolved artifacts in cache in a file. This file can then be used to define a classpath corresponding to all the resolved dependencies for any java program.

'''

*__since 1.4__*

[source,shell]
----
java -jar ivy.jar -settings path/to/myivysettings.xml -dependency bar foo 2.0 -main org.bar.foo.FooMain
----

calls ivy with given ivysettings file and resolves the dependency `bar` `foo` `2.0`, and then runs `org.foo.FooMain` class with the resolved artifacts as classpath
