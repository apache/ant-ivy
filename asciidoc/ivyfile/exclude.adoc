*Tag:* exclude *Parent:* link:../ivyfile/dependencies.html[dependencies]

*__since 2.0__* This feature gives you more control on a dependency for which you do not control its ivy file. It allows to exclude artifacts, modules or organizations from the list of dependencies for the whole module.

It is very similar to the link:../ivyfile/artifact-exclude.html[dependency exclude] element, except that it applies to a whole module, which can be very useful when a lot of dependencies transitively bring a module you don't want.
