*Tag:* include *Parent:* link:../ivyfile/configurations.html[configurations]

Include configurations specified in another file. *__since 1.3__*

The included file should have a `configurations` tag as root tag, which follow the same specification as the link:../ivyfile/configurations.html[configurations] tag of the ivy file.

This means that it can contain conf declarations, other file inclusion, and also a `defaultconfmapping`.

When delivering an ivy file with such an inclusion, the included configuration file is inlined, i.e. ivy remove the dependency on the external file.

== Examples

[source,xml]
----
<ivy-module version="1.0">
  <info organisation="myorg"
         module="mymodule"
  />
  <configurations>
    <include file="path/to/included-configurations.xml"/>
    <conf name="conf3"/>
  </configurations>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency name="mymodule1" rev="1.0"/>
    <dependency name="mymodule2" rev="2.0" conf="conf2,conf3->*"/>
  </dependencies>
</ivy-module>
----

with `included-configurations.xml` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<configurations defaultconfmapping="*->@">
  <conf name="conf1" visibility="public"/>
  <conf name="conf2" visibility="private"/>
</configurations>
----

Defines 3 configurations, `conf1`, `conf2` and `conf3`. `mymodule1` is required in each configuration, with for each the same configuration (`conf1` is needed in `conf1`, `conf2` in `conf2`, and `conf3` in `conf3`) due to the `defaultconfmapping` defined in the included file.
