*Tag:* dependencies *Parent:* link:../ivyfile.html[ivy-module]

Container for dependency elements, used to describe the dependencies of this module. 
If this container is not present, it is assumed that the module has no dependency at all.

This container provides for two similar behaviors.  An overview is given here.  (See link:../ivyfile/configurations.html[configurations doc page] for more details about these behaviors).

*__since 1.1__* `defaultconf` defines the `conf` attribute to use when no conf is defined for a dependency in this ivy file. It is only used when no conf mapping is defined, and has no influence in other cases.

*__since 1.3__* `defaultconfmapping` influences the way that a conf mapping with no mapped conf is interpreted.

In Ivy 2.1.0 and earlier, if both `defaultconf` and `defaultconfmapping` are defined, it's the `defaultconfmapping` that is used. Since Ivy 2.2.0, these attributes can be used together.

== Attributes

[options="header",cols="15%,50%,35%"]
|=======
|Attribute|Description|Required
|defaultconf|the default configuration to use when none is specified in a dependency. *__since 1.1__*|No, defaults to `$$*->*$$`
|defaultconfmapping|the default configuration mapping to use in this ivy file. *__since 1.3__*|No, defaults to no default conf mapping
|=======


== Child elements


Note: as specified by the ivy.xsd, the children elements are ordered; must come first the `link:../ivyfile/dependency.html[dependency]` elements, then the `link:../ivyfile/exclude.html[exclude]` elements, then the `link:../ivyfile/override.html[override]` elements, and then the `link:../ivyfile/conflict.html[conflict]` elements.


[options="header",cols="20%,60%,20%"]

|link:../ivyfile/override.html[override]|specify an override mediation rule, overriding the revision and/or branch requested for a transitive dependency *__since 2.0__*|0..n
|link:../ivyfile/conflict.html[conflict]|specify a a conflict manager for one or several dependencies *__since 2.0__*|0..n
