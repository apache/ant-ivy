*Tag:* include *Parent:* link:../ivyfile/dependency.html[dependency]

This feature gives you more control on a dependency for which you do not control its ivy file. 
It enables to restrict the artifacts required by including only the artifacts given here, even if configuration does not a good separation of published artifacts.

Each artifact restriction can be given in the context of particular master configurations. By default, if no configuration is specified, artifacts restriction apply to all master configurations. But you can specify that a restriction applies only to one or several master configurations, using either inline or nested conf specification. In this case, do not forget that if you do not specify any restriction for a particular configuration, then no restriction will apply for this configuration and it will be resolved not taking into account any restriction.

For instance, imagine you have A, B & C master configurations. If you restrict to art1 in A & B and art2 in A, then C will not be restricted at all, and will thus get all artifacts of all dependency configurations if you do not specify a configuration mapping. To prevent this, you have to specify a configuration mapping for the dependency, mapping only A & B to some or all dependency configurations.

Example:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency org="yourorg" name="yourmodule9" rev="9.1" conf="A,B->default">
  <include name="art1" type="jar" conf="A,B"/>
  <include name="art2" type="jar" conf="A"/>
</dependency>
