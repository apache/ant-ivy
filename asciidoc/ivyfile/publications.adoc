*Tag:* publications *Parent:* link:../ivyfile.html[ivy-module]

Container for `artifact` elements, used to describe the artifacts published by this module.

If this container is not present, it is assumed that the module has one artifact, with the same name as the module, and published in all module configurations.

Thus if you have a module which publishes no artifacts (a sort of virtual module, made only to integrate several other modules as a whole), you have to include a publications element with no `artifact` sub element.
