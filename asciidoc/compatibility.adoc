== JVM compatibility

Up to Ivy 2.3.x, a minimum of Java 1.4 is required.

For Ivy 2.4.0, a minimum of Java 5 is required.

Since Ivy 2.5.0, a minimum of Java 7 is required.

Since Ivy 2.5.1, a minimum of Java 8 is required.

== Apache Ant

Ivy doesn't require a specific version of Ant as long as the Ant being used complies with the JVM compatibility requirements noted above.

== Other optional dependencies

The required versions of the Apache HttpClient, Jsch or any optional dependency are to be checked against Ivy's dependency descriptor. In Ivy's source, check for the `ivy.xml` file at the root. Or the `pom.xml` of `org.apache.ivy#ivy` in the Maven Central repository.

== Environment / Configuration Requirements

Ivy does not at this time support multithreaded use. It thus should not be used with the Ant `<parallel>` task.
