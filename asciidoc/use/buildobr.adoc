*__since 2.3__* From a set of jar artifacts, this task generates an OBR (OSGi Bundle Repository) descriptor. It could be then used by the link:../resolver/obr.html[obr resolver].

The set of jars which will be described by the OBR can be defined in 4 exclusive ways:

* via an Ivy resolver: every jar listed by the resolver will be taken into account
* by defining a root directory: every jar found recursively in that folder will be taken into account
* via the name of an Ivy cache: every artifact contained in the cache will be taken into account
* *__since 2.4__* via a resolve: this task is a link:../use/postresolvetask.html[post resolve task] (with all the behaviour and attributes common to all post resolve tasks), thus ever artifact which has been resolved will be taken into account; it is especially useful for building a link:../osgi/target-platform.html[target platform]

NB: among every listed files or artifacts, only the actually OSGi bundles will be described by the OBR descriptor; the other files are ignored. 

== Attributes

*__since 2.4__* This is a link:../use/postresolvetask.html[post resolve task], with all the behaviour and attributes common to all post resolve tasks.

|Attribute|Description|Required
|out|the location of the descriptor file to generate|Yes

== Examples

[source,xml]
----
    <ivy:buildobr baseDir="${eclipse.home}" out="${basedir}/target/repo-eclipse.xml" indent="true" />
----

Builds an indented OBR descriptor from an Eclipse install, with their path relative to the Eclipse install.

----
    <ivy:configure file="ivysettings.xml" />
    <ivy:buildobr resolverName="my-file-resolver" out="${basedir}/target/repo-eclipse.xml" />
----

Configure an Ivy settings and builds an OBR descriptor from jars resolved by the defined resolver.

'''

[source,xml]
----
    <ivy:configure file="ivysettings.xml" />
    <ivy:buildobr cacheName="my-cache" out="${basedir}/target/repo-eclipse.xml" />
