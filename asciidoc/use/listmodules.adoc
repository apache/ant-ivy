*__since 1.4__*
Finds the list of modules in the repository matching some criteria and set a corresponding list of properties in ant.

The criteria is set by given patterns matching the organisation, name branch and revision of the modules to find.

To know if a module matches the criteria ivy will use the configured link:../concept.html#matcher[pattern matcher].

== Examples

[source,xml]
----
<ivy:listmodules organisation="apache" module="ivy" revision="*" property="ivy.[revision]" value="found"/>
----

will find all revisions of the module ivy in the org apache, and create one property for each revision found, the name of the property depending on the revision, the value being always `found`

'''

[source,xml]
----
<ivy:listmodules organisation="*" module="ivy*" revision="1.0" matcher="glob" property="modules.[module]" value="[organisation]"/>
----

use the glob matcher to find all modules which name starts with ivy with revision 1.0, and sets for each a property with module name found  and organisation for value.
