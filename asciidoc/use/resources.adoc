*__(since 2.3) (Ant 1.7 required)__*
`ivy:resources` is an Ant link:http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/resources.html#collection[resource collection], which files are based on an Ivy resolve, and then can be used with any task which is working with resources like `copy` or `import`.

This datatype share the same attributes, child elements and behaviour of a link:../use/postresolvetask.html[post resolve task]. It is not expected to be used as an Ant task though, only as a resource collection.
