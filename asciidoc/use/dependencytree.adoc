Display a dependency tree on the console.

This is a link:../use/postresolvetask.html[post resolve task], with all the behaviour and attributes common to all post resolve tasks.

Please prefer the use of retrieve + standard ant path creation, which make your build more independent from Ivy (once artifacts are properly retrieved, Ivy is not required any more).

== Attributes

[options="header",cols="15%,50%,35%"]
|=======
|Attribute|Description|Required
|showEvicted|specify if evicted modules should be printed|No. Defaults to `false`
|conf|a comma separated list of the configurations to take in consideration in the  dependency tree|No. Defaults to the configurations resolved by the last resolve call, or `*` if no resolve was explicitly called
|haltonfailure|`true` to halt the build on ivy failure, `false` to continue|No. Defaults to `true`
|validate|true to force ivy files validation against ivy.xsd, false to force no validation|No. Defaults to default ivy value (as configured in configuration file)
|settingsRef|A reference to the ivy settings that must be used by this task *(since 2.0)*|No, defaults to `ivy.instance`.
|overwrite|Overwrite the value of the property if it already exist *(since 2.0)*.  Before 2.0, the properties were always overwritten.|No, `false` by default.
|=======

== Example

Suppose we have two dependencies one called __mydep__ in revision 2.0 and one called __myotherdependency__ in revision 2.2.
__mydep__ has a transitive dependency on __mytransitivedependency__ in revision 2.2.

Then:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencytree />
----

will display the following tree in the console:

[source]
----
Dependency tree for foobar
+- org#mydep;2.0
   \- org#mytransitivedependency;2.2
\- org#myotherdependency;2.2");
----
