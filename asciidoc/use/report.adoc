Generates reports of dependency resolving. One report per configuration is generated, but all reports generated together are hyperlinked one to each other.

This task should be used only after a call to resolve, even if the call was not done during the same ant build.
In fact, this task uses xml report generated by resolve in cache. So if you call resolve on a module for a given configuration, you can call report safely on this module and this configuration as long as you do not clean your ivy cache.

If you want to have an idea of what reports look like, check this very simple link:../samples/jayasoft-ivyrep-example-default.html[example].
The task also generates a graphml file which can be loaded with the free link:http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.htm[yEd] graph editor.
Then following a few link:../yed.html[simple steps] you can obtain a graph like this link:../samples/jayasoft-ivyrep-example-default.jpg[one].

*__since 1.4__* If a custom XSL is specified, it's possible to specify additional parameters to the stylesheet.
