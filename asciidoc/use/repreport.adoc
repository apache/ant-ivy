Generates reports about dependencies among several modules in the repository (repreport stands for repository report).*__since 1.4__*

This task is similar to the link:../use/report.html[report] task, except that instead of working on a single module you just resolved, it works with a set of modules in your repository.

Note that the set of modules for which you generate the report is determined by setting organisation module and revision and using a matcher, but also by the dependencies of these modules. No dependency is excluded.

Usually the most useful report is a graph, you can generate either a graphml file that you can then easily link:../yed.html[layout using yEd], or a dot file which is the format recognized by graphviz, which is a free tool which does automatic graph layout, and can thus be used to generate automatically a GIF or PNG of the dependencies between all your modules.

*Limitation*: this task requires to be able to browse the repository, and is thus limited to resolvers supporting repository listing. In particular, it means it doesn't work to report all organizations in a repository using m2compatible mode.
Moreover, to be able to list organizations, this task requires an [organisation] token in the resolver(s) used.

== Attributes

[options="header",cols="15%,50%,35%"]
|=======
|Attribute|Description|Required
|organisation|A pattern matching the organisation of the modules for which the report should be generated|No, defaults to `$$*$$`
|module|A pattern matching the name of the modules for which the report should be generated|No, defaults to `$$*$$`
|branch|The name of the branch of the modules for which the report should be generated|No, defaults to no branch specified
|revision|The revision of the modules for which the report should be generated. Only one revision per module will be used, so most of the time keeping the default (`latest.integration`) is the best thing to do, because it's not very easy to specify only one revision for several modules.|No, defaults to `latest.integration`
|todir|the directory to which reports should be generated|No, defaults to execution directory
|outputname|the name to use for the generate file (without extension)|No, defaults to `ivy-repository-report`
|xml|`true` to generate a xml report, `false` otherwise|No, defaults to `true`
|xsl|`true` to generate a report using xslt, `false` otherwise|No, defaults to `false`
|xslfile|indicates which xsl file should be used to generate the report|Yes if you want to use xsl transformation
|xslext|indicates the extension to use when generating report using xsl|No defaults to `html`
|graph|`true` to generate graphml file, `false` otherwise|No, defaults to `false`
|dot|`true` to generate graphviz dot format file, `false` otherwise|No, defaults to `false`
|matcher|the name of the matcher to use for matching modules names and organisations in your repository|No. Defaults to `exactOrRegexp`
|validate|`true` to force ivy files validation against ivy.xsd, `false` to force no validation|No. Defaults to default ivy value (as configured in configuration file)
|settingsRef|A reference to the ivy settings that must be used by this task *__(since 2.0)__*|No, defaults to `ivy.instance`.

== Examples

To generate a xml report for all the latest versions of all the modules in your repository:

[source,xml]
----
<ivy:repreport />
