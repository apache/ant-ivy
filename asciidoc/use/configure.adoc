The `configure` task is used to configure ivy with an xml settings file.

See link:../settings.html[Settings Files] for details about the settings file itself.

*__since 2.0__* The file loaded used to be called __configuration__ file in versions prior to 2.0. The name __settings__ and the use of the `ivy.settings.file` is new to 2.0.

*__since 2.0__* It is also possible to configure Ivy with the link:../use/settings.html[settings] declaration. The difference with this task is that when using the settings declaration, the configuration of Ivy will be done when the settings are first needed (for instance when you do a resolve), while the configure task will perform a configuration of Ivy instantly, which makes it easier to see the problem if something goes wrong.

== Attributes

[options="header",cols="15%,50%,35%"]
|=======
|Attribute|Description|Required
|settingsId|The settings id useable in the `settingsRef` attributes of the Ivy task that needs a setting.|No, defaults to `ivy.instance`
|file|path to the settings file to use
.2+|No. If a file is provided, url is ignored. If none are provided, then it attempts to find a file at `${ivy.settings.file}`, and if this file does not exist, it uses `${ivy.settings.url}` *__(since 2.3)__* or a link:../samples/ivysettings-default.xml[default settings file]
|url|url of the settings file to use
|override|Specify what to do when another settings with the same id has already been loaded. +
* `true`: the current settings will take precedence over any previously defined setting with this id +
* `false`: the current settings will not override a previously defined setting with this id +
* `notallowed`: an error is raised if a settings has already been defined with this id|No, defaults to `notallowed`
|host|HTTP authentication host
.4+.^|No, unless authentication is required
|realm|HTTP authentication realm
|username|HTTP authentication user name
|passwd|HTTP authentication password
|=======

== HTTP Authentication

If any of the url you use in Ivy (especially in dependency resolvers) needs http authentication, then you have to provide the `host`, `realm`, `username` and `passwd` attributes of the configure task. These settings will then be used in any further call to Ivy tasks.

*Since 1.4:*
It's also possible to configure authentication settings for multiple urls. This can be done with the `<credentials>` subelements. See the examples for more details.

== Examples

=== Simplest settings

[source,xml]
----
<ivy:configure />
----

Use either `${ivy.settings.file}` if it exists, or the link:../samples/ivysettings-default.xml[default settings file]

=== Configure with a file

[source,xml]
----
<ivy:configure file="myconffile.xml" />
----

=== Configure with an url

[source,xml]
----
<ivy:configure url="http://mysite.com/myconffile.xml" />
----

=== Configure multiple URLs which require autentication

[source,xml]
----
<ivy:configure file="path/to/my/ivysettings.xml">
  <credentials host="myhost.com" realm="My Realm" username="myuser" passwd="mypasswd" />
  <credentials host="yourhost.com" realm="Your Realm" username="myuser" passwd="myotherpasswd" />
</ivy:configure> 
----
