= URL resolver

[]
|=======
|Tag|url
|Handle latest|yes with HTTP URLs (and Apache server) and with file URLs, no with other URLs
|Handle publish|yes with HTTP URLs whose destination supports publishing (as of Ivy 2.0)
|=======


[ivysettings.resolvers.url]#This resolver is one of the most generic. In fact, most of the previous resolvers can be obtained by a particular configuration of this one.# Indeed it uses URLs to find Ivy files and artifacts. The URLs it uses are defined through Ivy and artifact children, each giving a pattern to find Ivy files or artifacts.

*Limitation*: in `m2compatible` mode, this resolver is not able list available organizations. It means some features like link:../use/repreport{outfilesuffix}[repreport] are not available.


== Attributes

This resolver shares the link:../settings/resolvers{outfilesuffix}#common[common attributes] of standard resolvers.

[options="header",cols="15%,50%,35%"]
|=======
|Attribute|Description|Required
|m2compatible|True if this resolver should be Maven 2 compatible, false otherwise (*__since 1.3__*)|No, defaults to false
|=======


== Child elements


[options="header"]
|=======
|Element|Description|Cardinality
|ivy|Defines a link:../concept{outfilesuffix}#patterns[pattern] for Ivy files, using the pattern attribute.|0..n
|artifact|Defines a link:../concept{outfilesuffix}#patterns[pattern] for artifacts, using the pattern attribute.|1..n
|=======



== Example


[source, xml]
----

<url name="two-patterns-example">
  <ivy pattern="http://ivyrep.mycompany.com/[module]/[revision]/ivy-[revision].xml"/>
  <artifact pattern="http://ivyrep.mycompany.com/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"/>
  <artifact pattern="http://ivyrep.mycompany.com/[module]/[revision]/[artifact].[ext]"/>
</url>

----

Looks for Ivy files in one place and for artifacts in two places: with or without revision in name (revision being already in the directory structure).
