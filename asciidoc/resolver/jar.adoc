[*__since 2.3__*]

[ivysettings.resolvers.jar]#This resolver uses a specified jar resolve Ivy files and artifacts.#

This kind of resolver helps the packaging of an entire repository. Since the entire "repository" jar is expected to be local at some point, the size of a such repository should be considered to be not too large if it is expected to be remote; hence the artifacts in a such repo should be little in size.

The configuration of such a resolver is done via specifying the location of the jar, and through Ivy and artifact patterns, indicating where Ivy files and artifacts can be found in the jar. You can indicate a list of patterns which will be checked one after the other. Note that the patterns *MUST NOT* start with a slash.


== Attributes

This resolver shares the link:../settings/resolvers{outfilesuffix}#common[common attributes] of standard resolvers.
