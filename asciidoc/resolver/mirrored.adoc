= Mirrored resolver

[]
|=======
|Tag|mirroredurl
|Handle latest|yes with http urls (and apache server) and with file urls, no with other urls
|Handle publish|no
|=======


*__since 2.3__*

This resolver can resolve dependencies against several mirrors of the same repository. From a list of mirror urls, it will iteratively try to resolve the dependencies against each one.


== Attributes

This resolver shares the link:../settings/resolvers.html#common[common attributes] of standard resolvers.

[options="header",cols="15%,50%,35%"]
|=======
|Attribute|Description|Required
|m2compatible|True if this resolver should be Maven 2 compatible, false otherwise|No, defaults to false
|mirrorListUrl|The url where to retrieve the list of mirror urls.|Yes
|=======


== Child elements


[options="header"]
|=======
|Element|Description|Cardinality
|ivy|defines a pattern for ivy files, using the pattern attribute|0..n
|artifact|defines a pattern for artifacts, using the pattern attribute|1..n
|=======



== Example


Having the file mavenrepolist.txt content:

[source]
----

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/
http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/

----

And the piece of settings:

[source, xml]
----

<mirroredurl name="mirrored-maven" m2compatible="true" mirrorListUrl="file:///Users/me/dev/repo/mavenrepolist.txt">
      <artifact pattern="[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"/>
</mirroredurl>

----

It will resolve first on the `repo1` and if failing it will fall back on `repo2`.


'''


The mirror list can be retrieved from a geo-location aware url:

[source, xml]
----

<mirroredurl name="mirrored-asf" mirrorListUrl="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi">
  <ivy pattern="repo/[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/ivy.xml"/>
  <artifact pattern="repo/[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"/>
</mirroredurl>
