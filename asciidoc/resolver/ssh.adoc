= SSH resolver

|Handle latest|yes

[*__since 1.4__*]

[ivysettings.resolvers.ssh]#This resolver can be used when your Ivy repository is located on a server accessible via SSH.# The secured nature of SSH and its widespread implementation on most *nix servers makes this resolver a very good candidate in an enterprise environment.

If your server supports SFTP, you can consider using the link:../resolver/sftp{outfilesuffix}[SFTP resolver].

Internally this resolver shares most of its behaviour with the link:../resolver/sftp{outfilesuffix}[SFTP resolver], so refer to its documentation for details.

== Attributes

This resolver shares the link:../settings/resolvers{outfilesuffix}#common[common attributes] of standard resolvers.

== Child elements


[options="header"]
|=======
|Element|Description|Cardinality
|ivy|Defines a link:../concept{outfilesuffix}#patterns[pattern] for Ivy files, using the pattern attribute.|0..n
|artifact|Defines a link:../concept{outfilesuffix}#patterns[pattern] for artifacts, using the pattern attribute.|1..n

== Example


[source, xml]
----

<ssh user="myuser" host="myhost.com">
  <ivy pattern="/path/to/ivy/[module]/ivy.xml"/>
  <artifact pattern="/path/to/[organisation]/[module]/[artifact].[ext]"/>
</ssh>

----

Will connect to myhost.com using myuser and prompt for the password.

'''


[source, xml]
----

<ssh keyFile="path/to/key/file" keyFilePassword="${password}">
  <ivy pattern="ssh://user:geheim@yourserver.com:8022/path/to/repos/[module]/[revision]/ivy.xml"/>
  <artifact pattern="ssh://user:geheim@myserver.com:8022/path/to/my/repos/[artifact].[ext]"/>
</ssh>

----

Will connect to yourserver.com on port 8022 with user geheim and use `path/to/key/file` for `keyFile` and the value of password variable for `keyFilePassword` authentication for Ivy files, and to myserver.com on port 8022 using user geheim with the same keyFile/keyFilePassword pair for the artifacts.


[source, xml]
----

<ssh host="myhost" sshConfig="/path/to/.ssh/config">
  <ivy pattern="/path/to/ivy/[module]/ivy.xml"/>
  <artifact pattern="/path/to/[organisation]/[module]/[artifact].[ext]"/>
</ssh>

----

Will connect to the host named by myhost according to the config file in `/path/to/.ssh/config`, using the hostname, username, and optionally IdentityFile specified in the config section "Host myhost". For example, if the corresponding Host section contains "Hostname yourserver.com" and "User myremoteusername", it will connect to yourserver.com using username myremoteusername.
