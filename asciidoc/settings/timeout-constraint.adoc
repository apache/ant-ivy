== Attributes


[options="header",cols="15%,50%,35%"]
|=======
|Attribute|Description|Required
|name|name of timeout constraint|Yes
|connectionTimeout|An integer value, in milli seconds, that will be used as the timeout while establishing a connection. +
A value greater than `0` is used literally as the timeout. +
A value of `0` indicates no timeout and typically translates to wait-forever kind of semantics. +
A value lesser than `0` lets the users of this timeout constraint decide what semantics to use. That effectively, implies implementation specific semantics|No, defaults to `-1`
|readTimeout|An integer value, in milli seconds, that will be used as the timeout while reading content from a resource to which an connection has been established. +
A value greater than `0` is used literally as the timeout. +
A value of `0` indicates no timeout and typically translates to wait-forever kind of semantics. +
A value lesser than `0` lets the users of this timeout constraint decide what semantics to use. That effectively, implies implementation specific semantics|No, defaults to `-1`

----
    <timeout-constraints>
        <timeout-constraint name="test-timeout-1" connectionTimeout="100" readTimeout="500"/>
        <timeout-constraint name="test-timeout-2" readTimeout="20"/>
        <timeout-constraint name="test-timeout-3" connectionTimeout="400"/>
        <timeout-constraint name="test-timeout-4"/>
    </timeout-constraints>
----
Here we see 4 timeout constraints defined:

    - `test-timeout-1` uses a connection timeout of 200 milli seconds and read timeout of 500 milli seconds.
    - `test-timeout-2` uses a read timeout of 20 milli seconds and lets the connection timeout default to -1.
    - `test-timeout-3` uses a connection timeout of 400 milli seconds and lets the read timeout default to -1.
    - `test-timeout-4` lets both the connection timeout and read timeout default to -1.
