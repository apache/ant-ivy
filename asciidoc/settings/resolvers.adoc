= resolvers

*Tag:* resolvers

Defines a list of dependency resolvers usable in ivy. Each dependency resolver is identified by its name, given as an attribute.

The child tag used for the dependency resolver must be equal to a name of a dependency resolver type (either built-in or added with the typedef tag).

*__since 1.3__* Once defined, resolvers can be referenced by their name, using the following syntax:

[source, xml]
----

<resolver ref="alreadydefinedresolver"/>

----

Note that this works only if the resolver has already been defined and *NOT* if it is defined later in the ivysettings file.

== Built-in Resolvers

Ivy comes with a set of built-in dependency resolvers that handle most common needs.

If you don't find the one you want here, you can also check if someone has contributed it on the links page, or even link:../extend.html[write your own].

There are basically two types of resolvers in Ivy - composite and standard. A composite resolver is a resolver which delegates the work to other resolvers. The other resolvers are standard resolvers.

Here is the list of built-in resolvers:


[options="header",cols="15%,50%,35%"]
|=======
|Name|Type|Description
|link:../resolver/ivyrep.html[IvyRep]|Standard|Finds ivy files on ivyrep and artifacts on ibiblio.
|link:../resolver/ibiblio.html[IBiblio]|Standard|Finds artifacts on ibiblio.
|link:../resolver/packager.html[Packager]|Standard|Finds ivy files and packaging instructions via URLs, then creates artifacts by following the instructions.
|link:../resolver/filesystem.html[FileSystem]|Standard|This very performant resolver finds ivy files and artifacts in your file system.
|link:../resolver/url.html[Url]|Standard|Finds ivy files and artifacts in any repository accessible with urls.
|link:../resolver/vfs.html[Vfs]|Standard|Finds ivy files and artifacts in any repository accessible with link:http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/vfs/[apache commons vfs].
|link:../resolver/ssh.html[ssh]|Standard|Finds ivy files and artifacts in any repository accessible with ssh.
|link:../resolver/sftp.html[sftp]|Standard|Finds ivy files and artifacts in any repository accessible with sftp.
|link:../resolver/jar.html[Jar]|Standard|Finds ivy files and artifacts within a specified jar.
|link:../resolver/chain.html[Chain]|Composite|Delegates the finding to a chain of sub resolvers.
|link:../resolver/dual.html[Dual]|Composite|Delegates the finding of ivy files to one resolver and of artifacts to another.
|link:../resolver/obr.html[OBR]|Standard|Resolve modules as OSGi bundles listed by an OSGi obr.xml.
|link:../resolver/updatesite.html[Eclipse updatesite]|Standard|Resolve modules as OSGi bundles which are hosted on an Eclipse update site.

== [[common]]Common features and attributes

All resolvers of the same type share some common features and attributes detailed here.

=== Features


==== validation

All standard resolvers support several options for validation.

The `validate` attribute is used to configure if ivy files should be checked against the ivy file xml schema.

The `checkconsistency` attribute allows you to enable or disable consistency checking between what is expected by Ivy when it finds a module descriptor, and what the module descriptor actually contains.

The `descriptor` attribute lets you define if module descriptors are mandatory or optional.

The `checksums` attribute is used to define the list of checksums files to use to check if the content of downloaded files has not been corrupted (eg during transfer).

==== force

Any standard resolver can be used in `force` mode, which is used mainly to handle local development builds. In force mode, the resolver attempts to find a dependency whatever the requested revision is (internally it replace the requested revision by `latest.integration`), and if it finds one, it forces this revision to be returned, even when used in a chain with `returnFirst=false`.

By using such a resolver at the beginning of a chain, you can be sure that Ivy will pick up whatever module is available in this resolver (usually a private local build) instead of the real requested revision. This allows to handle use case like a developer working on modules `A` and `C`, where `A -> B -> C`, and pick up the local build for `C` without having to publish a local version of `B`.
*__since 2.0__*

==== timeoutConstraint

*__since 2.5__*

All standard resolvers support the `timeoutConstraint` attribute. The value for this attribute is the name of the link:timeout-constraint.html[timeout-constraint] that's been defined in the Ivy settings.

Resolvers can be optionally configured to use a `timeoutConstraint` so that the timeouts defined on that constraint dictate how the resolvers behave when it comes to dealing with timeouts while establishing connections and reading content, during module descriptor and artifact resolutions.

==== Maven


Any resolver which is able to parse a Maven pom.xml file has to detect the related sources or javadocs artifacts. This often involves several network connections even if neither the sources nor the javadoc are requested to be downloaded.

*__since 2.5__* Setting the property `ivy.maven.lookup.sources` to `false` disable the lookup of the sources artifact.
And setting the property `ivy.maven.lookup.javadoc` to `false` disable the lookup of the javadoc artifact.

== Examples


[source, xml]
----

<resolvers>
  <filesystem name="1" cache="cache-1">
    <ivy pattern="${ivy.settings.dir}/1/[organisation]/[module]/ivys/ivy-[revision].xml"/>
    <artifact pattern="${ivy.settings.dir}/1/[organisation]/[module]/[type]s/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]"/>
  </filesystem>
  <chain name="chain1">
    <resolver ref="1"/>
    <ivyrep name="ivyrep"/>
  </chain>
  <chain name="chain2" returnFirst="true" dual="true">
    <resolver ref="1"/>
    <ibiblio name="ibiblio"/>
  </chain>
</resolvers>

----

Defines a filesystem resolver, named `1`, which is then used in two chains, the first which combines the filesystem resolver with an ivyrep resolver, and second which combines the filesystem resolver with an ibiblio resolver, and which returns the first module found, and uses the whole chain to download artifacts (see corresponding resolvers documentation for details about them).   Resolver `1` will use a cache named `cache-1` which should have been defined under the caches element.
