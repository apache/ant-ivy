*Tag:* settings

[ivysettings.settings]#Configures some important Ivy behaviour: default resolver, latest strategy, conflict manager and some others.#

The default resolver is used whenever nothing else is configured in the modules section of the settings file. It should give the name of a dependency resolver defined in the link:../settings/resolvers{outfilesuffix}[resolvers] section of the settings file.

The default latest strategy and conflict manager can also be configured here.

_validate_ indicates if Ivy files should generally be validated against the Ivy XSD or not. This setting is only a default value, and can be overridden:

    1. in Ant tasks
    2. in resolvers

So if there is a setting in the resolver, it always wins against all other settings.
