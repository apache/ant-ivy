<span class="since">since 2.3</span> From a set of jar artifacts, this task generates an OBR (OSGi Bundle Repository) descriptor. It could be then used by the <a href="../resolver/obr.html">obr resolver</a>.

The set of jars which will be described by the OBR can be defined in 4 exclusive ways:
<ul>
<li>via an Ivy resolver: every jar listed by the resolver will be taken into account</li>
<li>by defining a root directory: every jar found recursively in that folder will be taken into account</li>
<li>via the name of an Ivy cache: every artifact contained in the cache will be taken into account</li>
<li><span class="since">since 2.4</span> via a resolve: this task is a [[ant:postresolvetask post resolve task]] (with all the behaviour and attributes common to all post resolve tasks), thus ever artifact which has been resolved will be taken into account; it is especially useful for building a <a href="../osgi/target-platform.html">target platform</a></li>
</ul>

NB: among every listed files or artifacts, only the actually OSGi bundles will be described by the OBR descriptor; the other files are ignored. 

<h1>Attributes</h1>

<span class="since">since 2.4</span> This is a [[ant:postresolvetask post resolve task]], with all the behaviour and attributes common to all post resolve tasks.

<h1>Examples</h1>
<code type="xml">
    <ivy:buildobr baseDir="${eclipse.home}" out="${basedir}/target/repo-eclipse.xml" indent="true" />
</code>
Builds an indented OBR descriptor from an Eclipse install, with their path relative to the Eclipse install.

<hr/>
<code type="xml">
    <ivy:configure file="ivysettings.xml" />
    <ivy:buildobr resolverName="my-file-resolver" out="${basedir}/target/repo-eclipse.xml" />
</code>
Configure an Ivy settings and builds an OBR descriptor from jars resolved by the defined resolver.

<hr/>
<code type="xml">
    <ivy:configure file="ivysettings.xml" />
    <ivy:buildobr cacheName="my-cache" out="${basedir}/target/repo-eclipse.xml" />
</code>
Configure an Ivy settings and builds an OBR descriptor from jars contained in the defined cache.

<hr/>
<code type="xml">
    <ivy:configure file="ivysettings.xml" />
    <ivy:resolve file="ivy.xml" />
    <ivy:buildobr out="${basedir}/target-platform-obr.xml" />
</code>
Launch a resolve and then build an obr.xml describing the resolved artifacts.
