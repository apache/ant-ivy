The resolve task actually resolve dependencies described in an <a href="../ivyfile.html">ivy file</a>, and put the resolved dependencies in the ivy cache.
If configure has not been called before resolve is called, a default configuration will be used (equivalent to call configure with no attributes).

After the call to this task, four properties are set in ant:
<ul>
<li>ivy.organisation</li>
set to the organisation name found in the ivyfile which was used for resolve
<li>ivy.module</li>
set to the module name found in the ivyfile which was used for resolve
<li>ivy.revision</li>
set to the revision name found in the ivyfile which was used for resolve, or a generated revision name if no revision was specified in the file
<li>ivy.resolved.configurations</li>
set to the comma separated list of configurations resolved
</ul>
<b>Since 1.2:</b>
An additional property is set to true if the resolved dependencies are changes since the last resolve, and to false otherwise: <code>ivy.deps.changed</code>

<b>Since 2.0:</b>
In addition, if the <i>resolveId</i> attribute has been set, the following properties are set as well:
<ul>
<li>ivy.organisation.${resolveId}</li>
<li>ivy.module.${resolveId}</li>
<li>ivy.revision.${resolveId}</li>
<li>ivy.resolved.configurations.${resolveId}</li>
<li>ivy.deps.changed.${resolveId}</li>
</ul>

When ivy has finished the resolve task, it outputs a summary of what has been resolved. This summary looks like this:
<pre>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
|                  |            modules            ||   artifacts   |
|       conf       | number| search|dwnlded|evicted|| number|dwnlded|
---------------------------------------------------------------------
|      default     |   4   |   0   |   0   |   0   ||   4   |   0   |
---------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
This table gives some statistics about the dependency resolution. Each line correspond to a configuration resolved. Then the table is divided in two parts:
<ul>
<li>modules</li>
<ul>
<li>number</li>
This is the total number of dependency modules resolved in this configuration, including transitive ones
<li>search</li>
This is the number of dependency modules that required a repository access. The repository access is needed if the module is not yet in cache, or if a latest version is required, or in some other cases (depending on checkModified, for instance)
<li>dwnlded</li>
This is the number of dependency ivy files downloaded from the repository. This number can be less than the total number of modules even with a clean cache, if no ivy file is provided for some dependencies.
<li>evicted</li>
This is the number of dependency module evicted by conflict managers.
</ul>
<li>artifacts</li>
<ul>
<li>number</li>
This is the total number of artifacts resolved in the given configuration.
<li>dwnlded</li>
This is the number of artifacts actually downloaded from the repository.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Inline mode</h2>
<span class="since">since 1.4</span> The inline mode allow to call a resolve without an ivy file, by setting directly the module which should be resolved from the repository. It is particularly useful to install released software, like an ant task for example. When inline is set to true, the organisation module and revision attributes are used to specify which module should be resolved from the repository.

<h2>Resolve mode</h2>
<span class="since">since 2.0</span> The resolve mode allows to define how Ivy should use dependency revision constraints when performing the resolution.

Two modes are available:
<ul>
<li>default</li> In this mode the default revision constraint (expressed with the rev attribute in the [[ivyfile/dependency]] element) is used.
<li>dynamic</li> In this mode the dynamic revision constraint (expressed with the revConstraint attribute in the [[ivyfile/dependency]] element) is used.
</ul>

<i>Note for developers:
After the call to this task, a reference to the module descriptor resolved is put in the ant project under the id <code>"ivy.resolved.descriptor"</code>.</i>
