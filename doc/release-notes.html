<h3>1. What is Apache Ivy?</h3>

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
   		Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
   		methodology or structure. 
   		Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
   		to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
   		processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
   		while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
   		with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
   		from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.

<h3>2. How to Get Involved</h3>

The Apache Ivy project really needs and appreciates any contributions, 
including documentation help, source code and feedback.  If you are interested

<h3>3. How to Report Issues</h3>
