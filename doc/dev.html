<h1>Building from source</h1>
To build Ivy from source it's really easy. 
<h2>Requirements</h2>
All you need is 
<ul>
<li>an <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">svn</a> client</li>
<em>to check out Ivy sources from apache svn, not required if you build from sources packaged in a release</em>
<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> 1.6.0 or greater</li>
<em>We recommend either ant 1.6.5 or 1.7.0</em>
<li><a href="http://junit.org">junit</a> 3.8.2 jar in your ant lib</li>
<em> this is not required if you use ant 1.7</em>
<li>a <a href="http://java.sun.com/">jdk</a> 1.4 or greater</li>
<em>Build instructions have been successfully tested with sun jdk 1.4.2, 1.5.0 and 1.6.0</em>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>Get the source</h3>
You can either get the sources from a [[download release]], or get them directly from svn. For instance, to get the trunk version:
<code>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/trunk ivy
</code>
<h3>Build</h3>
Go to the directory where you get the Ivy sources (you should see a file named build.xml) and run:
<code>
ant
</code>
<h3>Check the result</h3>
The ant build will download Ivy if you don't already have a proper version in your home, compile, and run tests with coverage metrics.
If everything goes well, you should see the message
<code>
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
</code>
Then you can check the test results in the build/doc/reports/test directory, the jars are in build/artifacts, and the test coverage report in build/doc/reports/coverage
<h1>Coding conventions</h1>
The Ivy code base is supposed to follow the standard java conventions:
http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html

This is a work in progress though (see IVY-511), but patches helping migration to these conventions are welcome.

<h1>Developing with eclipse</h1>
Even though you can develop Ivy with your IDE of choice, we support eclipse development by providing ad hoc metadata.

We currently provide two options:
<h2>Eclipse alone</h2>
To develop with a simple eclipse install all you need is eclipse 3.1 or greater, with no particular plugin.
First call the following ant target in your Ivy workspace:
<code>
ant eclipse-default
</code>
This will resolve the dependencies of Ivy and produce a .classpath using the resolved jars for the build path.
Then you can use the "Import->Existing project into workspace" eclipse feature to import the Ivy project in your workspace.
<h2>Eclipse + IvyDE</h2>
You can also leverage the latest IvyDE version to be able to easily resolve the ivy dependencies from Eclipse.
To do so all you need is call the following ant target in your Ivy workspace:
<code>
ant eclipse-ivyde
</code>
or if you don't have ant installed you can simply copy the file .classpath.ivyde and rename it to .classpath
Then you can import the project using "Import->Existing project into workspace" as long as you already have latest IvyDE installed.

To install latest IvyDE version compatible with the latest Ivy used to resolve Ivy dependencies, you will need to use a snapshot build, not endorsed by the ASF, available here:
http://people.apache.org/~xavier/ivyde/snapshot/

Download the file and unzip its content in your eclipse installation directory.

<h1>Making a release</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
Requirements for making a release are similar to the requirements for building from source, except that sun jdk 1.6 and ant 1.7 are required.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>1. Check the files which needs to be updated for the release.</h3>
On the trunk, check that files which require update for the release are up to date.
This includes particularly:
RELEASE_NOTES
CHANGES
README
<h3>2. Create a release branch</h3>
This will allow to work separately from other developers, in case you need any last modification.
<code>
svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/trunk \
           https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/branches/2.0.0-alpha1 \
      -m "Creating a release branch for 2.0.0-alpha1."
</code>
<h3>3. Check out the branch</h3>
<code>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/branches/2.0.0-alpha1 ivy-2.0.0-alpha1
</code>
<h3>4. Double check the files which need to be updated for the release.</h3>
Check again that files have proper revision information.
It's also time to update the documentation template files which will be used for doc generation to include the version information in the page title.
For instance in
<code>
doc/template.html
doc/printTemplate.html
</code>
replace
<code>
<title>${title} | Ivy Documentation</title>
</code>
by
<code>
<title>${title} | Ivy 2.0.0-alpha1-incubating Documentation</title>
</code>
<h3>5. Add release note page in the documentation.</h3>
Open the file doc/index.html with your favorite browser, and click on the plus button in the upper right. Choose "Release Notes" as title, and "release-notes" as page id. 

Then edit the page (hit the first button at the upper right), and copy the content of the RELEASE_NOTES file in a pre section:
<code>
<pre>
Here comes the release notes...
</pre>
</code>

You can also add the announcement for the release if it's already ready. If this is an incubator version, add the usual incubator disclaimer too.

Move the page up in the TOC using the arrow button in the toolbar at the upper right, so that it's the first child page under the "Documentation" page.

The page could then look like something like that:
http://incubator.apache.org/ivy/history/2.0.0-alpha-1.html

<h3>6. Commit your changes</h3>
<code>
svn ci -m "update templates and add release notes in documentation."
</code>
<h3>7. Check that you have no pending modifications</h3>
<code>
svn status
</code>
If your working copy is clean, you can launch the release script. If it isn't, make sure to clean it properly. Sometimes you may need to call ant clean-all if you have started to work with ant builds. If you are confused about your working copy state, delete it and check it out again.
<h3>8. Launch the release script</h3>
<code>
ant -Dbuild.version=2.0.0-alpha1-incubating -Dstatus=milestone -f build-release.xml release
</code>
The status should be release only for final releases, and milestone for any other intermediate release.
If anything is wrong, fix and go back to step 4.
If the release script is successful, release artifacts will be waiting for you in the build/distrib directory.
<h3>9. Verify the release</h3>
Check that all zips can be opened correctly, and that running 'ant' after unzipping the source distribution works properly.
You can also do a smoke test with the generated ivy.jar , to see if it is able to resolve properly a basic module (for instance you can run some tutorials provided in the src/example directory in all distributions).
<h3>10. Sign and upload the artifacts</h3>
It's now time to sign the release artifacts and upload them to a location accessible by other Apache commiters.

Here is a simple way to sign the files using gnupg:
<code>
gpg --armor --output file.zip.asc --detach-sig file.zip
</code>

Here is a ruby script you can use to sign the files:
<code>
require 'find'

Find.find('build/distrib') do |f| 
    `gpg --armor --output #{f}.asc --detach-sig #{f}` if File.file?(f) && ['.zip', '.gz'].include?(File.extname(f))
end
</code>
Be prepared to enter your passphrase several times if you use this script, gpg will ask for your passphrase for each file to sign.

<h3>11. Cast a vote to approve the release</h3>
Cast a vote to approve the release, first on the ivy-dev mailing list, then if it is approved, on the general@incubator.apache.org mailing list
<h3>12. Tag the svn repository</h3>
Now that the release is approved, it is time to tag the svn repo
<code>
svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/branches/2.0.0-alpha1 \
           https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/tags/2.0.0-alpha1 \
      -m "Tag release 2.0.0-alpha1."
</code>
<h3>13. Upload to public repository</h3>
If the release is approved, it's now time to make it public by uploading it to the public Apache distrib repository (i.e. /www/people.apache.org/dist/incubator/ivy/[version] on people.a.o).

<h3>14. Update the web site</h3>
Add a link to the released version documentation in the web site. 

To do so, you need to:
<ol>
<li>add a svn externals reference to the documentation</li>
edit the svn properties of site/history, and in the svn:externals property, add a line like this one:
<code>
2.0.0-alpha2 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/branches/2.0.0-alpha2/doc
</code>
<li>edit the toc.json file in the site component of Ivy</li>
and add something like that:
<code>
{
   "title":"2.0.0-alpha2",
   "importRoot":"history/2.0.0-alpha2",
   "importNode":"index"      
}
</code>
<li>Add a call to init-imported-version in site/build.xml</li>
In the init-imported-history target, add a task call like this one:
<code>
<init-imported-version version="2.0.0-alpha2" />
</code>
</ol>
Then launch "ant init-imported-history" in the site directory, and check the documentation now has the released version in the history, and that this documentation can be accessed with no problem with a unified TOC.

Then you can update the release notes page of the imported documentation if necessary, to include the announcement for example.

It's time to update the download image used on the home page and the download page. Use site/images/ivy-dl.xcf as a basis if you have <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a> installed. Then you can update the home page to refer to this image, and add a news item announcing the new version. Update also the download page with the new image and update the links to the download location.

You are now ready to commit your changes (make sure to commit changes in imported locations too), and update the online site:
<code>
ant clean publish-site
</code>

<h3>15. Announce</h3>
Announce the release on the ivy-dev and ivy-user mailing lists, on the general@i.a.o list, announce@apache.org and on the user@ant.apache.org.
Announce also the release on Ivy web site by editing the doc/index.html on the trunk.
You can also announce the release on popular web sites, like freshmeat.net (xavier is the owner of the Ivy project on freshmeat), javalobby.org, theserverside.com, dzone.com, ...
<h3>16. Update this doc</h3>
If you feel like anything is missing or misleading in this release doc, update it as soon as you encounter the problem.
<h3>17. Merge your modifications back to the trunk if necessary.</h3>
Modifications on the template files do not need to be merged, but if you had troubles during your release you may want to merge your fixes back to the trunk.
<h3>18. Prepare next release</h3>
Update the file version.properties with the version of the next release so that anyone building from the trunk will obtain jar with the correct version number.

Release the version in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY">jira</a>, and create a new unreleased version for the next planned version.</textarea>
