The buildlist task enable to obtain a filelist of files (usually build.xml files) ordered according to ivy dependency information from the least dependent to the most one, or the inverse. (<span class="since">since 1.2</span>)

This is particularly useful combined with subant, to build a set of interelated projects being sure that a dependency will be built before any module depending on it.

<span class="since">since 1.3</span> A root attribute can also be used to include, among all the modules found, only the one that are dependencies (either direct or transitive) of a root module. This can also be used with the excluderoot attribute, which when set to true will exclude the root itself from the list.

<span class="since">since 1.4.1</span> A leaf attribute can also be used to include, among all the modules found, only the one that have dependencies (either direct or transitive) on a leaf module. This can also be used with the excludeleaf attribute, which when set to true will exclude the leaf itself from the list.

<span class="since">since 1.4</span> The ivy.sorted.modules property is set in the ant at the end of the task with a comma separated list of ordered modules. This can be useful for debug or information purpose.

<span class="since">since 2.0</span> The root and leaf attributes can be a delimited list of modules to use as roots.  These modules, and all their dependencies will be included in the build list.

<h2>Parameters specified as nested elements</h2>
<h3>fileset</h3>
FileSets are used to select sets of files to order.
<h1>Examples</h1>
<code type="xml">
    <ivy:buildlist reference="build-path">
      <fileset dir="projects" includes="**/build.xml"/>
    </ivy:buildlist>
</code>
Builds a list of build.xml files sorted according to the ivy.xml files found at the same level (the default value for ivyfilepath is ivy.xml).

This list can then be used like that:
<code type="xml">
    <subant target="build" buildpathref="build-path" />
</code>

<hr/>
<code type="xml">
    <ivy:buildlist reference="build-path" ivyfilepath="ivy/ivy.xml" reverse="true">
      <fileset dir="projects" includes="**/build.xml"/>
    </ivy:buildlist>
</code>
Builds a list of build.xml files sorted according to the ivy.xml files found in an ivy directory relative to those build files. The list is sorted from the most dependent to the least one.
<hr/>
<code type="xml">
    <ivy:buildlist reference="build-path" ivyfilepath="ivy/ivy.xml" root="myapp">
      <fileset dir="projects" includes="**/build.xml"/>
    </ivy:buildlist>
</code>
Builds a list of build.xml files sorted according to the ivy.xml files found in an ivy directory relative to those build files. Only build.xml files of modules which are dependencies of myapp (either direct or transitive) are put in the result list.
<hr/>
<code type="xml">
    <ivy:buildlist reference="build-path" ivyfilepath="ivy/ivy.xml" leaf="mymodule">
      <fileset dir="projects" includes="**/build.xml"/>
    </ivy:buildlist>
</code>
Builds a list of build.xml files sorted according to the ivy.xml files found in an ivy directory relative to those build files. Only build.xml files of modules which have dependencies (direct or transitive) on mymodule are put in the result list.
