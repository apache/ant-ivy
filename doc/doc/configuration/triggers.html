<b>Tag:</b> triggers
<span class="since">since 1.4</span>

Defines a list of triggers to activate on some Ivy events.

A trigger is an action which is performed whenever a particular event occurs.
Ivy supports two type of triggers out of the box: ant-call and ant-build. The first calls a target in the same build as the original one whenever a particular event occurs, the second call an ant build which may be in another ant build script.

If you want to use a different trigger, you can <a href="../../doc/extend.html">implement your own</a>.

The event available in Ivy are the following ones:

The child tag used for the dependency resolver must be equal to a name of a trigger type (either built-in or added with the typedef tag).

<h1>Child elements</h1>

<h1>Built-in Triggers</h1>
Ivy comes with two built-in triggers: 

<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>ant-build<a href="../../doc/trigger/ant-build.html"></a></td><td>Triggers an ant build.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ant-call<a href="../../doc/trigger/ant-call.html"></a></td><td>Calls a target in the current ant build.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h1><a name="common">Common attributes</a></h1>
All triggers share some common attributes detailed here.

Among these attributes, you will find how to select when the trigger should be performed. You have to provide an event name, which is simple, but you can also use a filter expression. The syntax for this expression is very simple and limited: 
you can use the = operator to compare an attribute (left operande) with a value (right operande).
you can use AND OR NOT as boolean operators
you cannot use parenthesis to change the precedence

<table class="ivy-attributes">
<thead>
    <tr><th class="ivy-att">Attribute</th><th class="ivy-att-desc">Description</th><th class="ivy-att-req">Required</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr><td>name</td><td>the name of the trigger for identification purpose only</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>event</td><td>the name of the event on which the trigger should be performed</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>filter</td><td>a filter expression used to restrict when the trigger should be performed</td>
        <td>No, defaults to no filter</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>

<h1>Examples</h1>
<code type="xml">
<triggers>
    <ant-build antfile="${ivy.settings.dir}/[module]/build.xml" target="publish"
           event="pre-resolve-dependency" filter="revision=latest.integration"/>
</triggers>
</code>
Triggers an ant build of the ant file ${ivy.settings.dir}/[module]/build.xml (where [module] is replaced by the name of the dependency resolved) with the target "publish", just before resolving a dependency with a latest.integration revision.
<hr/>
<code type="xml">
<triggers>
    <ant-call target="unzip" prefix="dep"
          event="post-download-artifact" filter="type=zip AND status=successful"/>
</triggers>
</code>
Triggers an ant call of the target unzip just after downloading a zip artifact, prefixing all parameters to the target with 'dep'.
Here is how the target can look like:
<code type="xml">
<target name="unzip">
     <echo>
        unzipping artifact: 
        organisation=${dep.organisation} 
        module=${dep.module} 
        revision=${dep.revision}
        artifact=${dep.artifact}
        type=${dep.type}
        ext=${dep.ext}
        origin=${dep.origin}
        local=${dep.local}
        size=${dep.size}
        file=${dep.file}
     </echo>
     <mkdir dir="${basedir}/out"/>
     <unzip src="${dep.file}" dest="${basedir}/out"/>
</target>
