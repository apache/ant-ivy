The best way to learn is to practice! That's what the ivy tutorials will help you to do, to discover some of the great ivy <a href="../features.html">features</a>.

Here is the very first tutorial, it doesn't even require to install Ivy, and should not take more than 30 seconds if you already have ant and a jdk properly installed:
<ul>
<li>make sure you have <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a> 1.6.2 or greater and a <a href="http://java.sun.com">jdk</a> properly installed</li>
<li>copy <a href="../samples/build.xml">this build file</a> in an empty directory on your local filesystem (and make sure you name it build.xml)</li>
<li>open a console in this directory and run "ant". That's it!</li>
</ul>
If you have any trouble, check the <a href="../faq.html">FAQ</a>, it may be related to your internet connection (proxy anyone?).

OK, you've seen how easy it is to make your first step with ivy? Go ahead with the other tutorials, but before make sure you have properly <a href="install.html">installed</a> ivy and downloaded the tutorials sources (included in all ivy distributions, in the [[svn:src/example]] directory).
